<h1 class="about-title">About Me</h1>
<div class="about-content>"
  <p> The name is Krouzz (a.k.a moses) a Nigerian, born April family of Mr & Mrs
Arulogun.</p>
    <p> Growing up has been always a Victory and most of the times there
      is always a lesson to be learnt, which has made my life more meaningful
      Ever since could remember my wrongs from the right which was actually
      knowing who i really was. Noticed that this live is embeded with Obstacles
      Realised a whole lot of ups and downs But what keeps me always going
      is me knowing that am definately going to be successful in life and
      it would only happen when i make the right decisions partaining every
      distinctions.</p>
      <p>The Journey began from never always go a day without being greatful
      for every little things, there came a day was in High School, was the day
    Nigeria played the finals of the African Cup of Nation Tournament also that
  same the the Soccer Club Manchester United played a leauge match, the good
news was that This day Signifies a new Beginning for me since those two team
played on the same day, i made my first Stake actually thinking that Gambling
against the bookers was an investment afterall all that is needed was to pick to
good teams playing of the same day with the Mentality of atleast one loss if i
staked four times a month then always staking high thought me allot of lessons
both positive and negative, dont know either to say my newbie luck made the both
team win that evening or the hardwork by deciding to actually Staking High
above all The Journey Began with a Win, was Excited so my addiction at this part
of my life was gambling, would call it an addiction because i took it to be an
investment but the bookers where actually ready for me first worked for them
durring Vacation, then was very exposed to Virtual Gambling which i now called
scam then very soon cant go one day without having to think about the game,
either thinking about my next strategy or how to raise funds for my next big so
investment. </p>
<p>The saying everything in Life happens for a reason, so was already planning
to get so big in this and actually opening mine with help from Pundicts
arround the world who requested to be paid either in Liberty Reserve(LR)
Perfect Money (PM) or Bitcoins (BTC) so was not in the legal age to really
own a bank account and involving parents would deffinately not work so decided
open a paypal account so could be able to purchase this digital currencies, so
to start my next big thing so ended up not using the paypal because of was young
and did not know the Implications of Masking sure you name was gotten correctly
that ddnt stoped me, so went further deeper, got understand that you could
purchase PM with cash and have the PM converted to BTC and versa so subscribed
and started this Jorney, always calculating never into the game, any time
made a decision out of proportion always ends up in the gabage so there was an
internal fight to continue then fight the distraction, and also getting
distracted by the virtual Gamble was so Intense, then was done and ready to
diversify after taking a huge loss, Ended up getting some funds from my father
and a laptop inherited from my brother so the next big thing was to get internet
subscription from the stories flying arround deep in the web, which was owning
bitcoin, so i lauged at first because it sounded like somthing which could get
my hands on because the only deficulty then was getting a secured bitcoin
wallet No one to run to, because just by having a laptop without having much
knowledge about how to min the Digital knowlege then connecting with miners
arround the world would net you bitcoins but no one was ready to sponsor your
internet subscriptions montly so mined a litle bought a little lost so many
but by then had little value, after sometimes drop the passion then was ready
for school it was when i was not enjoying much of my time in scool that was the
time Bitcoin resurfaced to me then there was enough amenities that provided easy
exchange to selling of bitcoins, sold much and kept plenty then went back to
mining for more Bitcoins so bitcoins made over $17,000 and attracted allot of
newbies, so bitcoin fell and i started Mining For Investors then bitcoin kept
falling and not having an extablied presence was also at hand so a time came
was getting so much pressure for payouts tried my best to keep them together
and delivered the bitcoins when Bitcoins crossed $8000, then investors trusted
easily because almost everyone who mins bitcoin was legitimate but no one was
actually ready to go public, thus landed me into another big mistake lost
connections with investors because had a one way communication to secure my
identity my investors also lost me when my gadgets got missing at a Birthday
party, can remember vividly crying like a baby on that blessed day No one
understood why was crying, because cant explain my self knowing it was a
vulnerability, so it went and was stronger and Better.</p>

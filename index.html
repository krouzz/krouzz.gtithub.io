<h3 class="post-title">SwiftUI in Playground tips and tricks</h3>
<div class="post-content">
  <p>Perhaps by now you have read lots of articles about SwiftUI, and if you
were lucky, you have had the chance to start a small project and get to know it.
<br>For me learning and trying new APIs starts from Playground,not Xcode.so
despite all other tutorials I am going to point out some  cool features of
SwiftUI using Playground.<br>
This article contains some basics and tips with examples which I mostly
learned at Swift Island Conference 2019 from Erica Sadun.</p>
<p>SwiftUI is a new/simple way to build user interfaces across all Apple
platforms. You all know the differences between building UI in code vs in
Interface builder.<br>SwiftUI is a declarative approach to build UI that covers
the flaws of the Imperative approach.</p>

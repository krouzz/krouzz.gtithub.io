<div class="post-content">
  <p>Perhaps by now you have read lots of articles about SwiftUI, and if you
were lucky, you have had the chance to start a small project and get to know it.
<br>For me learning and trying new APIs starts from Playground,not Xcode.so
despite all other tutorials I am going to point out some  cool features of
SwiftUI using Playground.<br>
This article contains some basics and tips with examples which I mostly

Interface builder.<br>SwiftUI is a declarative approach to build UI that covers
the flaws of the Imperative approach.</p>
